# User Interface Assignment
A repository for my first OOP assignment in second year.

#### Brief
 - "Use Processing to create a UI for a sci-fi movie device like a warp drive, engines, weapons system. You can base it on any movie you like or come up with your own. It should be kinda usable. It should have lots of animation & interactivity and look amazing. It can be as far out as you like. In other words it can be for an alien."

#### My Idea
- My first idea was to make something on a game that I play or used to play, I have decided that I would go with a RuneScape theme, using the most elite bosses from the game for my assingment, I have picked Telos and Araxxor, starting off with two characters possibly more I want to try and create some sort of statistics or maybe a description when a user has the chance to select on a specific area on the character.

#### Update: 1st of November 2016
- I have devloped the User Interface and changed it as I kept getting new ideas, I have added a loading screen and background images which I hope to make them zoom in smoothly, the starting menu and the character select menu are complete the main focus now is to work on the characters and add the some cool features to them.

#### Update: 27th of November 2016
- Code has been heavily refactored, a lot of fixing done with the character select menu, navigation throughout the UI and now works, last task for this assignment is to make use of the file I/O and create some nice bar chart statistics for the chracters.

- Graphs have now been added both for Telos and Araxxor, the last part I look to get done is the live graph which shows the hits made by the boss.

- Live graphs have now been added to both of the chracters.

#### Testing
- This program has been tested on a Mac and it works without any bugs, navigation works the way it should work, you can only watch the loading screen once, once you have selected it you can't select it again.

- Skip button works perfectly which replaces the loading screen button once it has been used or can be used at any time.

- Selecting characters works the way it should work and the graphs display extremely well. File I/O displays correctly too which gives the correct results for the statistics graphs.

#### Evaluation
- Overall I am happy with my project, the loading screen aspect was the one that I liked the most, the images zoom in slowly while they dim up their brightness while playing the suitable music intro track for it.

- Final releases have been added, three vidoes have also been added, one without sound, one with sound and one where I explain while running the program.
